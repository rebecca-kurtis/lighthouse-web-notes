## Notes for Thursday October 20th: 

if you want to grab all changes at once in git you can use `git add -a or --all or . ` when commiting, be as descriptive as possible to avoid getting lost or not knowing what you have done.

You can use `git log` to see what you have done

git is the version control software in our computer. Git hub is the backup software you can use to store it on their system so it is always safe. 

`git remote -v` will list all current remote repositories. 

`process.argv;` gets the command line arguments for you

`.isInteger` checks if it is a whole number

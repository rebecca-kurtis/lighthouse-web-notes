## Notes for Thursday October 27th:

If you want to invoke a function you need the `()`. 

Callback: the function that is passed into another function for later execution. 

High order functions: 
1. accepts one or more functions to run as arguments 
2. returns one or more functions as a result. 

Arrow syntax function =>
- only one arguement means you don't need to have the argument parthenthesis 

ex1: 
``` javascript
const example = (arg) => {
  //logic
};
``` 

ex2: 
``` javascript
const example = arg => {
  //logic
};
```

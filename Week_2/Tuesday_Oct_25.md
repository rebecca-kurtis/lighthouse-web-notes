## Notes for Tuesday October 25th Lecture:

Arrays, and objects are `Data Structures` 

`Primitive Data` types are:
- strings
- integers
- undefined/null
- booleans

Objects are for describing a specific item. 
Whenever you want a list of something you use an array. 

Can access an object value using `bracket notation` or `dot notation`.
ex: object.key or object["key"]

Values can be assigned anything, even arrays and objects. 

`...` - spread operator - clones the array/object/element to a new item. 

Arrays and objects are references. 

Methods are functions that usually attach to something ie `.join()`

for..of is for looping through an array. 
for..in (for looping through objects) it returns a key

`this` means a reference to the object itself. When it is inside an object.
